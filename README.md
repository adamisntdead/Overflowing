## What this is about

Stack Overflow is ome of the best places for programmers to get answers to their programming problems and questions.

I created this to really let me know how much I use code from Stack Overflow.

This works by logging how many times you copy on stack overflow, and compiles them into a nice little chart which you can always look at, through the chrome extension.
Oh and it syncs across your desktop chrome browsers.
